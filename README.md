# LED Glove Theremin!

Uhm, this code is embarrasingly bad... sorry!

## What is it?

Watch this YouTube Video for an explanation...  TODO add link

## To Run

First you need to get Processing from processing.org.

Run "digitzone.pde".  I use an external camera.  You may need to modify the camera index to be `0` instead of `1` if you don't use an external one.

The colors are coded for my gloves as well as for my camera.  You may need to modify the colors to match your gloves / your camera.  This can be done by presenting an LED to the camera and clicking the color with your mouth.


## How to play...

* Horizontal placement of thumb determines tone
* Distance from thumb to:
    * index finger determines volume of base note
    * middle finger determines volume of major 3rd above base
    * ring finger determines volume of major 5th above base
    * pinky determines volume of octave above base
